"Hello. My name is Ram, and I am a highly certified Cloud and DevOps leader with 11 years of experience specializing in building scalable, secure, and automated solutions across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

Currently, I serve as a Lead DevOps Engineer at UST Global in Bangalore, where I am responsible for driving strategic initiatives and mentoring a team of four professionals.

Strategic Impact & Expertise
My focus has always been on maximizing developer efficiency and organizational agility. This involves:

Strategic CI/CD & Automation: I don't just implement pipelines; I design them to accelerate release cycles while enforcing security and compliance from the start, often using my expertise in Terraform and Ansible to manage complex, multi-cloud infrastructure (primarily Azure and GCP).

Advanced Cloud Architectures: I lead the implementation of containerization and orchestration solutions using Kubernetes and Docker for environments spanning both cloud and on-prem.

Observability & Security Leadership: I ensure enterprise-grade reliability by designing sophisticated Monitoring and Observability systems (using tools like Prometheus and ELK), and I mandate security best practices, including secrets management via HashiCorp Vault.
